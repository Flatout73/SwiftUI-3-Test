Application was written using Xcode 13.0 beta 3, tested on iPad OS beta 3.

I use architecture that was provided by Apple in their [sessions](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/226) (someone called it EML).

I tried to write the app as simple as possible using predefined modifiers/propertyWrappers/functions in newest SwiftUI, so there is not separate models for views, just use models from Core Data with SectionedFetchRequest.
